# Find Home Application

## Technologies used

- ReactJs as JS Framework
- CSS - Bootstrap
- Basic HTML
- Npm as React installer
- ESLint
- ES6

React uses componential structure which I have used for single app component. This component stores the data in the state which can be used across the component.
I can use the Redux with React for managing the state globally. But Since, this application is small and data is manageable in single state, Redux is not required for it.

Apart from that, Bootstrap is used to design the page exactly mentioned in the task. I have used its classes to make them responsive for all the devices. 
Also, Added the basic css styling along with the bootstrap to make it look more better.

The nodeJs and npm installer are required to run this application.

This application can also be done with VanillaJS and Angular 4. But, Personally I love working with React. Hence, I have used that framework. :)
